# Raymarine/Nautech Autohelm 3000 control board

Here is a KiCad project of the schematic and layout of the Raymarine/Nautech
Autohelm 3000 control board, a late 80s/early 90s autohelm for sailboats.

These designs were captured by analysing some Autohelm 3000 boards with a
magnifying glass and a multimeter set to the "beep" continuity mode.

There may be errors, use with caution.

At present this is just the schematic, and the position of the symbols
mirrors the location of the components on the PCB.  Coming soon is a
reorganised schematic which rearranges position of the components to make
how the board functions a lot clearer.
