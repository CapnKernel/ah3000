# Raymarine/Nautech Autohelm 3000 control board

Here is a KiCad project of the schematic and layout of the Raymarine/Nautech
Autohelm 3000 control board, a late 80s/early 90s autohelm for sailboats.

These designs were captured by analysing some Autohelm 3000 boards with a
magnifying glass and a multimeter set to the "beep" continuity mode.

There are errors, use with caution.  Component sizes and positions are only approximate.
